# IMU_OpticalFlow
This project is iOS implementation of sparse optical flow based on Lucas Kanade and and dense optical flow based on Farneback algorithms. The aim of the project is to gather IMU data from the device and normalise the optical flow with IMU data so that the resultant flow is representitive of only the motion of the observed object (scene) and irrespective of camera movement.
